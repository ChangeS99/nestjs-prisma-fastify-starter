## Getting Started

To start using Prisma Migrate, ensure you have the following:

1. A `schema.prisma` file with your data models
2. A configured database connection in the `datasource` block
3. Prisma CLI installed (`npm install -g prisma`)

## Creating Migrations

To create a new migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
```

This will:
1. Create a new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory
2. Apply the migration to your database
3. Generate the Prisma Client

## Applying Migrations

To apply pending migrations to your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Rolling Back Migrations

To rollback a migration:

1. Manually revert the changes in your database
2. Delete the corresponding migration folder from `prisma/migrations`

## Best Practices

1. Always create migrations for schema changes
2. Test migrations in a development environment before applying to production
3. Keep your migration history in version control
4. Use descriptive migration names
5. Review the generated SQL before applying migrations
